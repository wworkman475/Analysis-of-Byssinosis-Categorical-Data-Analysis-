# Analysis-of-Byssinosis (Categorical-Data-Analysis)

This was my final group project for my catagorical data analysis class. In this project, we analyzed a dataset containing several variables related to Byssinosis, a form of pneumoconiosis (respiratory disease), which workers exposed to cotton dust are subject to contracting. The data was collected at a cotton plant in North Carolina in 1973, on 5,419 individuals. Our goal was to uncover relationships between Byssinosis and several covariates, including:

Type of work place [1 (most dusty), 2 (less dusty), 3 (least dusty)]

Employment, years [<10, 10â€“19, 20+]

Smoking [Smoker or not in last 5 years]

Sex [Male, Female]

Race [White, Other]

Byssinosis [Yes, No]
